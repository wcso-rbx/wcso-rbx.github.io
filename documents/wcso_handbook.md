## SEC. 6: Recruitment

The specifics of recruitment policy are defined by the Captain of the Training and Recruitment. All stages are handled by the Training and Recruitment Division. Broadly, the stages of recruitment from application to deputization are the following:

**1. Application:** The Woodside County Sheriff's Office recruits new members on a rolling basis, meaning that applications remain open indefinitely until prohibited by budgetary requirements or special circumstances. This means that prospective cadets may submit applications at any time.

**2. Interview:** A live interview is conducted in-game at the department headquarters. Applicants will be given the opportunity to address concerns with their application and to ask any questions they have regarding next steps and the department at this stage.

**3. Background Investigation:** The Training and Recruitment Division refers the file to the Criminal Investigations Division for a background check. A second interview with the applicant may be conducted at the discretion of the Criminal Investigations Division.

**4. Review of File:** The investigative file is provided to the Training and Recruitment Division from the Criminal Investigations Division, where a decision on the applicant is made using the investigative file, interview notes, and application.

**5. Offer:** The candidate is presented with an offer of employment.

**6. Training:** The new cadet undergoes the training curriculum defined by the Captain of Training and Recruitment, and completes it within two weeks.

**7. Deputization:** The cadet takes the Oath of Honor, and is appointed a deputy of the Woodside County Sheriff's Office.

At any point during or between stages 1 to 5, candidates may be deemed non-competitive and removed from the applicant pool, during which time they will be notified by a recruiter. Candidates removed from the applicant pool are ineligible to reapply until 21 days has elapsed since they were informed of their removal from the applicant pool. Omission of serious adverse information from the application or interview may result in the revocation of offer if one results, and/or termination from the department.

## SEC. 7: Inspections and Training Standards

Bi-weekly inspections are hosted by the Sheriff in order to assess overall operational readiness of the department and evaluate the effectiveness of leadership. All inspections are hosted on weekends, with the exact weekend day and time varying between inspections to accomodate the different schedules of deputies.

The specifics of the training curriculum are defined by the Captain of Training and Recruitment, but must train and educate new applicants on the following topics at a minimum: Sections 2-5, 7-8, and 10 of this handbook; the policies and activity standards of the Routine Operations Branch; and definitions of actual, potential, and perceived conflict of interest.

### Oath of Honor

Successful completion of the training curriculum is followed by the administration of the Oath of Honor by the Captain of Training and Recruitment or a designee thereof.

*On my honor, I will never betray my badge, my integrity, my character, or the public trust. I will always have the courage to hold myself and others accountable for our actions. I will always uphold the Constitution, the community, and the agency I serve, so help me God* (optional).


## SEC. 8: Disciplinary Action

Generally, disciplinary action is the purview of the Internal Affairs Division. Cases of misconduct, violation of internal policy, transgressions of the law, and public complaints must be investigated by the Internal Affairs Division. Following this, the Internal Affairs Division makes an appropriate order on disciplinary action to close the case, if deemed necessary. The exceptions to this are terminations as emergency preventative action in cases of extremely grave or life-threatening misconduct, or violations of internal policy that do not concern the law and are not grave.

The heads of each division (usually Captains) are empowered to unilaterally suspend members under their area of responsibility who are subordinate to them for up to 48 hours. Suspensions are periods of time, definite or indefinite, in which a member is ordered to refrain from entering service or participating in law enforcement or departmental administrative duties. A given member can only be disciplined in this fashion once per two-week period. The head of the division must refer the case to the Internal Affairs Division if they wish for the member to be suspended for more than 48 hours, or if they wish for the member to be suspended another time within the two-week period. This power ensures that heads of divisions are able to efficiently handle minor instances of misconduct without significant bureaucratic overhead.

Where an instance of misconduct concerns a potential criminal act, the Internal Affairs Division must work in conjunction with the Criminal Investigations Division and alongside prosecutors if applicable.

The Internal Affairs Division is empowered to investigate and order disciplinary action against any member of the Woodside County Sheriff's Office up to and including member holding the rank of Assistant Sheriff. Decisions of the Internal Affairs Division will be supported by the Sheriff so long as they are made free of conflict of interest, are informed by objectively reasonable interpretations of available evidence, and are not manifestly unjust with respect to outcomes on similar cases in the past.

Members cannot be punished by both the head of their division and by order of the Internal Affairs Division for the same incident, unless the punishment was manifestly inappropriate with respect to the gravity of the circumstances. This is a finding that the Internal Affairs Division is empowered to make.

Appeals of disciplinary action are heard by the Assistant Sheriff of the Administration Branch by a process they define.

## SEC. 9: Interbranch Transfers

A member may transfer to a different branch within the Woodside County Sheriff's Office with the consent of the Assistant Sheriffs of both branches concerned. If the member is of rank Lieutenant or senior, consent of the Undersheriff is required.

Before an interbranch transfer occurs, access to all originating branch resources no longer required by the member must be revoked. Revocation of such access is the responsibility of the member's chain of command.

## SEC. 10: Termination of Service

The service of a member may be terminated for reasons such as resignation, unsatisfactory performance, or violation of law or internal policies. Prior to departure, they must transfer control and ownership all departmental resources under their control, which may include but are not limited to Discord servers, Trello boards, policy documents, or databases to a member within their chain of command. Appropriate action must be taken to ensure that such department resources are returned. When a member departs, access to all departmental resources must be revoked expeditiously. The responsibility for ensuring removal of such access falls on the chain of command for the member.

Prior to a member's resignation, their chain of command should be notified at least 72 hours in advance so that appropriate arrangements for transfer of departmental resources can be made.

## SEC. 11: Awards and Commendations

The Sheriff may, on the advice of the Undersheriff, designate awards including ribbons and other devices that may be worn on the uniform. These may be issued for acts of bravery, length of service, exceptional performance, or other reasons. Awards may or may not be accompanied by written commendations, which may be issued by Assistant Sheriffs, the Undersheriff, or the Sheriff. Written commendations are published publically by the Public Relations and Internal Affairs Division and may also be issued alone without an award.

There are currently no designated awards.
